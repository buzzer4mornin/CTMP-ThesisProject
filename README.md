## Collaborative Topic Model for Poisson distributed ratings with BOPE (MAP Estimation With Bernoulli Randomness)
CTMP is hybrid and interpretable probabilistic content-based collaborative filtering model for recommender system. The model enables both content representation by admixture topic modelling (LDA), and computational efficiency from Poisson factorization living together under one tightly coupled probabilistic model, thus addressing the limitation of previous methods.
For estimating some of the parameters with use BOPE algorithm - MAP Estimation With Bernoulli Randomness.
