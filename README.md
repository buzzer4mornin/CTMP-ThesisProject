# Master Thesis -  "Probabilistic models for Recommender Systems"
## Collaborative Topic Model for Poisson distributed ratings (CTMP) with the application of Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation with Bernoulli randomness (BOPE)  
 
CTMP is a hybrid and interpretable probabilistic content-based collaborative filtering model for recommender system. The model enables both content representation by admixture topic modelling called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and computational efficiency from Poisson distributed ratings living together under one tightly coupled probabilistic model, thus addressing the limitation of previous methods. The paper was released in April 2018, and it is considered one of the latest approaches in commercial product recommendation.  
For estimating some of the parameters with use BOPE algorithm - MAP Estimation With Bernoulli Randomness.
